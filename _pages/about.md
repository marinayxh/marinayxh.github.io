I am a first year student that will graduate in May 2021 from Vanderbilt University with masterâ€™s degree in data science program, and I am actively looking for an internship in summer 2020. I have mainly used R for coding and been good at data cleaning and visualization. Having good understanding on feature engineering, I have interests in machine learning. One of the related experiences is about building modeling refer to the problem of employee retention and introducing the model to six HR from local companies. I have been playing more often with Python and MySQL now. Moreover, I have worked in community-based setting for two years, so building good relationships and having valuable communications are what I also focus on.
